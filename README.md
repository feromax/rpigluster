Welcome to the Raspberry Pi Gluster Project!  If you have 4 x [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) single-board computers and USB hard drives (or even thumb drives), you can use Redhat Ansible with this project to build
* a reliable and redundant storage volume via GlusterFS
* that is shared with your computers using Samba (Windows, MacOS, and Linux compatible)
* with an awesome dashboard powered by Prometheus and Grafana.

If you're looking to learn some DevOps topics or just build an inexpesive NAS that will give most retail units a run for their money, you're in the right place!
